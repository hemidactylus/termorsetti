# Termorsetti

An Arduino project to monitor temperature and humidity to a web
server, all while having gummi bears with lights inside.

# Circuitry
Arduino Yun, two thermistors, a DHT11 digital temp/humidity module, three LEDs, a gummi bear, three 10kOhm resistors, three 220 Ohm resistors.

# Sketch
A library is required: DHT library (https://github.com/adafruit/DHT-sensor-library)

# Status
It is a work in progress
